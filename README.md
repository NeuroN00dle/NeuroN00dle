# NeuroN00dle 🧠 🍜
## BIO
- I'm a SWE at Google working on LLMs, deep learning and other stuff!
- One day I realized my understanding of many concepts are at a high level, and I don't fully know (or recall) the details.
- So here is an account to practice and learn things at a more fundamental level.
- Wish me luck!
